# This is an example script to copy nfcapd files to HDFS.
# It should be run after each cycle. E.g.:
#
# 'peer1'  => { 'port' => '9995', 'col' => '#0000FF', 'optarg' => '-x "/opt/nfsen/bin/nf2hdfs %d/%f"'}
#
# If there are many sources, default delay of 15s might not be
# long enough to copy all the files and should be increased.
